## 🌟 Overview

Sapphire is a revolutionary platform that empowers individuals and institutions to manage cultural heritage data with unprecedented security, privacy, and user control. By leveraging Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and integrating with the robust Dataverse ecosystem, Sapphire provides a sustainable and user-centric alternative to traditional persistent identifier systems like DOI and Handle.

Our mission is to democratize data, giving users true ownership of their digital identity and metadata, while ensuring full compliance with GDPR.

## 🧩 The Challenge

In the digital age, managing vast amounts of cultural heritage data presents significant challenges:
*   **High Costs:** Creating and maintaining millions of identifiers is expensive.
*   **Lack of User Control:** Users have little say over how their personal metadata is used.
*   **Data Silos:** Centralized systems limit data accessibility and community collaboration.
*   **Privacy Risks:** Ensuring GDPR compliance in large, interconnected systems is complex.

Sapphire addresses these challenges head-on with a decentralized, cost-effective, and privacy-preserving solution.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **🆔 Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs):** At the core of Sapphire is a W3C-compliant DID system. This allows for self-sovereign identity, where users control their own identifiers and associated data without relying on a central authority.
*   **📚 Dataverse Integration:** Seamless integration with Harvard Dataverse, a leading open-source research data repository. Users can link their DIDs to datasets, manage permissions, and enhance metadata.
*   **🔐 GDPR-Compliant by Design:** Sapphire is built from the ground up with privacy in mind. We provide tools for consent management, data portability, and the "right to be forgotten," ensuring full adherence to GDPR principles.
*   **🤖 AI-Powered Metadata:** Utilize AI to enrich and enhance metadata for cultural heritage artifacts, improving discoverability and research value.
*   **⛓️ Wallet-Based Authentication:** Secure, passwordless authentication using blockchain wallets (SIWE - Sign-In with Ethereum), aligning with the principles of decentralization and self-sovereign identity.
*   ** empowering User Control:** A user-friendly dashboard allows individuals to manage their data, control access permissions, and track usage with a transparent audit trail.
