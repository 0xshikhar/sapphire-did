Problem statement we are solving with Sapphire Project

ðŸ§©
Challenge Overview
Development of a scalable, GDPR-compliant Decentralised Identifier (DID) system as a sustainable, user-centric addition to existing persistent identifier infrastructures (DOI, Handle). The system will integrate with Dataverse and be demonstrated through AI applications to showcase decentralised metadata management and user empowerment in cultural heritage data contexts. Objectives Deliver a prototype DID system compatible with GDPR. Reduce costs associated with massive identifier creation. Enhance user control over personal metadata. Increase data accessibility and community engagement. Align with major priorities: inclusivity, security, and sustainability.
